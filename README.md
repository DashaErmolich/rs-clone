## Project Description

Our application was inspired by Open Spotify and gives the possibility to find and listen your favorite tracks.

We have used [Deezer REST API](https://developers.deezer.com/api) for getting music data and created our oun [server](https://github.com/Sylphur/RS-MusicApp-server) to authentificate users and store their data. Server is deployed to [heroku]( https://music-app-user-server.herokuapp.com/api) and you don't need to install it for app usage.

### App features:

- authentification with e-mail confirmation;
- listen track examples (only 30 s) with search in different categories;
